Solution:
Step 1:
Join the 2 tables based on post_id
 Step 2:
 Filter the post who have the reaction heart
 Step 3:
 Use Distinct to get the unique Post.

Code: 
# Import your libraries
import pyspark.sql.functions as f

# Start writing code
facebook=facebook_reactions\
          .join(facebook_posts,facebook_posts.post_id==facebook_reactions.post_id)
          .filter(facebook_reactions.reaction=='heart')
          .select(facebook_posts.post_id,facebook_posts.poster,facebook_posts.post_text,facebook_posts.post_keywords,facebook_posts.post_date).distinct()
