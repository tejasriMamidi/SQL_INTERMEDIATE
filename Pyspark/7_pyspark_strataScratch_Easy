discussion:

step 1: apply window aggregation avg() function to fetch the average salary for each department 
step 2:create the windowspec 
step 3: import the function from the spark.function module
step4: Select only the column which need to be displayed.

Solution:

import pyspark 
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import avg,col
windowSpec = Window.partitionBy("department")
emp_df=employee.withColumn('avg_salary',avg(col("salary")).over(windowSpec)).select("department","first_name","salary","avg_salary")

# To validate your solution, convert your final pySpark df to a pandas df
emp_df.toPandas()
