Solution:
# Import your libraries
import pyspark
import pyspark.sql.functions  as f

# Start writing code
df=spotify_worldwide_daily_song_ranking.groupBy("artist")\
.agg(f.count("*").alias("n_occurences"))
df_fin=df.orderBy(f.col("n_occurences").desc())

# To validate your solution, convert your final pySpark df to a pandas df
df_fin.toPandas()
