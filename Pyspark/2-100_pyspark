Solution:
step 1:
Filter the nominees who name is Abigail Breslin
step 2:
Use the aggreagate function countDistinct to get the number of time he got nominated.

Code:

import pyspark.sql.functions as f

# Start writing code
oscar_nominees=oscar_nominees.filter("nominee='Abigail Breslin'").select(f.countDistinct("MOVIE"))

# To validate your solution, convert your final pySpark df to a pandas df
oscar_nominees.toPandas()
