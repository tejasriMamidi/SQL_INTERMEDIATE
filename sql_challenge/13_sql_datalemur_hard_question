Q13)You work as a data analyst for a FAANG company that tracks employee salaries over time. The company wants to understand how 
the average salary in each department compares to the company's overall average salary each month.

Write a query to compare the average salary of employees in each department to the company's average salary for March 2024. 
Return the comparison result as 'higher', 'lower', or 'same' for each department. Display the department ID, payment month (in MM-YYYY format), 
and the comparison result.

Solution:
with tgt as(
SELECT distinct emp.department_id
,  payment_date,
round(avg(amount) over(PARTITION BY department_id),2) as dept_avg,
round(avg(amount) over(),2) as avg_total
FROM employee emp
join salary s
on emp.employee_id=s.employee_id
where
extract(year from payment_date)='2024' 
and extract(month from payment_date)='03')

select department_id, 
concat('0',
date_part('month', payment_date),'-',
date_part('year', payment_date))as payment_date,
case when dept_Avg> avg_total then 'higher'
when dept_Avg<avg_total then 'lower'
else 'same' end comparsion
from tgt
