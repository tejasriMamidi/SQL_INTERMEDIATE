Q12)This is the same question as problem #25 in the SQL Chapter of Ace the Data Science Interview!

Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages and time spent sending and opening snaps.

Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs. opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.

Notes:

Calculate the following percentages:
time spent sending / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
Time spent opening / (Time spent sending + Time spent opening)
To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 and not 100.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Discussion:
step1: join the tables based on the common column id
step2: fetch the age_bucket along with the activity by using the case statement.
step3: apply the formuale to by aggregating the column with age bucker.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
solution:

select age_bucket,
round((sum(send_activity)/sum(open_activity+send_activity)) * 100.0,2) as send_perc ,
round((sum(open_activity)/sum(open_activity+send_activity))* 100.0,2) as open_perc
from (

SELECT 
abd.age_bucket ,
case
when activity_type='open'
then time_spent
else 0
end as open_activity,
case 
when activity_type='send'
then time_spent
else 0 end 
as send_activity
FROM activities u
join age_breakdown abd
on u.user_id=abd.user_id) tgt
group by 1;
